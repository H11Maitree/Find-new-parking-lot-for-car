# Find-new-parking-lot-for-car
This is the my final project for online course : DSE200x: Python for Data Science

# Abstract
In order to reduce the number of owned cars, the city of Tel Aviv launched a shared-car project, called AutoTel.
The concept is so simple just pick the phone find the nearby car in the nearby parking lot then grab it.
The big problem of project and huge obstacle for user is sometimes in the vitrified parking lot there is no car available, so the customer need to walk to the other car parking lot which is more far from them.
 
 #Motivation
The question is “where is the best place to set up a new parking lot”
What mean “best” for this project?
● The location need to be set at the high car running out problems area.
● The number of location need to be appropriate and worth to invent.
○ That mean if number of the new car location too high the company would not be able to
invent.
○ And sometimes when we add more location it might not have a significant change in
performance
